# Who's NEXT?

Who's NEXT? is about ranking players without knowing who's coming next. Players are ranked by a criteria the user chooses. At the end of the ranking the user is scored based on number of correct answers.

## Future Features

    - Add filter for just using top 100ish players
    - When spun up, if data is more than 1 week old. Refetch.
